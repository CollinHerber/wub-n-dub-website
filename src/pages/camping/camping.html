            <h4>Car Camping</h4>
            Car Camping spots are 30’x 12’. Car camping passes are limited and must be purchased separately from General Admission tickets. One pass is required per car. Your car must remain parked at your campsite throughout the weekend.


            <h4>Venue</h4>
            The venue is located in Willard, NC. You’ll find yourself immersed in the natural beauty of the land immediately upon entering the venue. Beautiful trees decorate the property while a river flows just down the hill from main stage.
