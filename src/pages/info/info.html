Service dogs must be marked and leashed at all times. Service dogs must always be in “full stay” when not performing the service for which they have been trained. Service animals in training are not service animals and therefore not permitted to attend the festival.

        <h4>Medical</h4>

        <h4>Security</h4>
        Every car entering the grounds will be thoroughly searched in an effort to locate and remove prohibited items. Attendees are also subject to search. Security officers reserve the right to deny entry to anyone.

        <h4>Leave No Trace</h4>
        This land should be left in the same if not better condition than we found it! Trash bags will be provided to you upon entering the festival and should be used for your campsite. Trash cans will be located throughout the festival. DO NOT throw cigarette butts on the ground. Trash bags will be collected from campsites at the end of the weekend.
