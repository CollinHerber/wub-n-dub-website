        Escape to a natural oasis far from the chaos of a bustling city. Relax on fourteen acres of private land surrounded by trees and bordered by the Northeast Cape Fear River. Open fields provide plenty of space for comfortable camping, as well as shaded areas under clustered trees for hammocking during the day. Spend time relaxing or flowing in the sun on the beach along the water. The land is easily accessible being less than ten minutes off Exit 390 on highway 40 West.

        <h4>Re-Entry</h4>
        Stock up on what you need for the weekend before arriving, and take advantage of the amazing vendors we’ll have on site, to reduce unnecessary traffic throughout the grounds. If you have to leave the grounds, you will be allowed to do so between 10:00 AM and 1:00 PM each day. If you do not make it back on site before 1:00 PM there is no guarantee that you will be allowed to drive back/park in your original spot. Cars are subject to search each time entering the festival grounds.

        <h4>Acceptable and Unacceptable forms of identification</h4>
        Acceptable forms are any U.S. government issued driver’s license or identification card provided that it contains a photograph, name, and date of birth. A U.S. or foreign government issued passport containing a photograph and date of birth.

        Unacceptable forms of identification include; school identification, work identification, birth certificate, unofficial copies of any identification, or a social security card.

        <h4>Food/Ice/water</h4>

        <h4>Fire Policy:</h4>
        Campfires are strictly prohibited. There will be a large supervised fire within the venue grounds. Fire spinning is allowed within a 50’ radius of the fire pit only. (No rogue fire within the campgrounds!)

        <h4>Service Dog Policy</h4>
        Service dogs are permitted, emotional support animals are not. A service animal performs specific, trained tasks to mitigate a specific disability. Service dogs must be marked and leashed at all times. Service dogs must always be in “full stay” when not performing the service for which they have been trained. Service animals in training are not service animals and therefore not permitted to attend the festival.

        <h4>Zero Tolerance Drug Policy</h4>
        Drugs and drug paraphernalia are strictly prohibited.

        <h4>Medical</h4>
        A centrally located medical tent will be staffed with an emergency medical team. Medical personnel will also be roaming the grounds throughout the weekend. Look for security, official staff, or harm reduction personnel to assist you in an emergency.

        <h4>Security</h4>
        Every car entering the grounds will be thoroughly searched in an effort to locate and remove prohibited items. Attendees are also subject to search. Security officers reserve the right to deny entry to anyone.

        <h4>Leave No Trace</h4>
        This land should be left in the same if not better condition than we found it! Trash bags will be provided to you upon entering the festival and should be used for your campsite. Trash cans will be located throughout the festival. DO NOT throw cigarette butts on the ground. Trash bags will be collected from campsites at the end of the weekend.
