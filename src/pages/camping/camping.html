                Campers can arrive as early as noon on Thursday April 7th; and no later than 10pm any night throughout the weekend. Festival goers with car camping passes are encouraged to arrive early to secure their spot.
            </p>

            <h4>Tent Camping</h4>
            Tent camping spots are 10’x10’. One tent camping spot is included in General Admission tickets. We encourage carpooling! Anyone tent camping & arriving alone must also purchase a “Single Occupant Parking Pass”. The tent camping parking lot is at the entrance to the venue grounds.

            <h4>Car Camping</h4>
            Car Camping spots are 30’x 12’. Car camping passes are limited and must be purchased separately from General Admission tickets. One pass is required per car. Your car must remain parked at your campsite throughout the weekend.

            <h4>Venue</h4>
            Escape to a natural oasis far from the chaos of a bustling city. Relax on fourteen acres of private land surrounded by trees and bordered by the Northeast Cape Fear River. Open fields provide plenty of space for comfortable camping, as well as shaded areas under clustered trees for hammocking during the day. Spend time relaxing or flowing in the sun on the beach along the water. The land is easily accessible being less than ten minutes off Exit 390 on highway 40 West.
